          <h2>About Kelvin</h2>
          <img src="images/kw.jpg" class="img-response img-circle" align="left"><p>My name is Kelvin Watson and I live in Portland, Oregon. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I obtained my Bachelor's Science in the Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada in 2007. Prior to obtaining my B.Sc(Pharm.), I completed third year in the Microbiology and Immunology program, also at UBC. As such, my educational background has mostly been in the life and health sciences.</p>
          <p>I decided to pursue the professional post-baccalaureate Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p>After almost seven years as a pharmacist, I decided it was time for a change. I left my position, and moved to the United States with my spouse in 2013. After some time off, I began to realize that I had largely ignored a passion of mine, computer science. Even during my years as a pharmacist, I often found myself more interested in the technical aspects of my profession, including automated dispensing, robotics, and various aspects of healthcare software.</p> 
          <p>Another significant reason why I have chosen this field of study is my husband. He is a software engineer who absolutely loves his career path, and he is a wonderful source of encouragement and inspiration.</p>
          <p>To date, I have successfully completed CS161, CS162, CS225 and CS352, and I'm currently enrolled in CS261, CS271 and CS290. I enjoy C and C++ programming. So far, I have found computer science to stimulate a more systematic way of thinking and approach to problem solving that I had not experienced in my formal education in the past. After completing this degree, I hope to pursue a career in either software development, or computational drug discovery, or both, realizing that neither are necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>
          <p>I would very much appreciate the opportunity to pursue research in computer science, but I do not necessarily know which avenues are available to me. I am uncertain where I should search as research opportunities sometimes feel inaccessible or limited to graduate students or those with more experience. However, I feel it would be wonderful to be able to pursue research at an early stage in my education.</p>
          <p>My interests beyond data structures include writing and producing my own music. I also am familiar with some digital music editing tools as one of my passions is writing and producing my own music. I am not an extremely active person, but I do enjoy weightlifting on my spare time as I feel it helps clear my mind. I live a simple lifestyle, and enjoy things like having coffee, visiting wineries, or having a meal outside in the sun.</p>
          <h2>Why the DailyMed API?</h2>
          <p>I chose this API mainly because of my background in the Pharmaceutical Sciences. I did not realize that these drug databases could be accessed through API's, so this assignment was a great eye-opener for me.</p>
